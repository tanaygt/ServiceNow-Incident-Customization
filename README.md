Custom Incident Form with sFone Model field in ServiceNow
# ServiceNow Incident Customization

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple customization in ServiceNow Incident form.  
I added a **custom field (sFone Model)**, made it mandatory, and tested it by creating a new Incident (INC0010002).  

## Steps Performed
1. Added new field `sFone Model` in Incident form.
2. Set it as mandatory.
3. Created a new Incident with Category = sFone.
4. Verified the record in Incident List.

## Learning Outcomes
- How to add custom fields in ServiceNow.
- How mandatory fields ensure data consistency.
- Basic end-to-end Incident management workflow.
